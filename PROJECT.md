# Project Management in Github / Azure

## 🧩 GitHub Projects – Lightweight, Developer-Centric 

- Kanban-style Boards for visual task tracking (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Real-time Collaboration with issues, pull requests, and comments linked directly to tasks
- Automation Rules to move cards based on PR status or issue updates
- Custom Fields & Views for filtering by priority, status, or assignee
- Milestones to group issues by release goals or deadlines
- Integration with GitHub Actions for CI/CD triggers tied to project progress
- Cross-repo Tracking to manage tasks across multiple repositories
- Flexible Planning for individuals or small teams without rigid process overhead

## 🛠️ Azure DevOps – Structured, Enterprise-Grade 
- Boards with Agile Templates (Scrum, Kanban, CMMI) for formal planning
- Work Item Hierarchies (Epics → Features → Stories → Tasks) for scalable tracking
- Sprints & Iterations to manage time-boxed delivery cycles
- Backlog Management with prioritization, forecasting, and roll-up views
- Dashboards & Analytics for velocity, burndown, and team performance
- Integrated CI/CD Pipelines via Azure Pipelines for automated builds and deployments
- Test Plans & Artifacts for QA workflows and package management
- Service Hooks & REST API for custom automation and external integrations
