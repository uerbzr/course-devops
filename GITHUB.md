# Git/Github Introduction

- Git is a version control system created by Linuis Torvalds (Linux Guy!)
- Github is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration.
- It uses Git as its underlying version control system.
- It allows developers to work together on projects, track changes, and manage code repositories.

## Basic Concepts

**Repository**: A storage space for your project, which contains all the files and their revision history.

**Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository.

**Branch**: A parallel version of the repository where you can make changes without
affecting the main codebase.

**Fork**: Take someone elses project from their account and put it in yours so you can improve it

**Pull Request**: A request to merge changes from one project into another, sort of opposite of the Fork so you can send back your updates/improvements.
